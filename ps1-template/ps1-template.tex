%    \item First item in a list
%        \begin{itemize}
%            \item First item in a list

\problem  % Problem 2

\begin{problemparts}
\problempart % Problem 2a
Solving recursively: \\
\textbf{Base case}: If $k$ is $<= 1$, then nothing needs to be done. Hence return.\\
\textbf{Recursive case}: If $k$ is $>1$,\\
Swap the elements at index $i$ and $i+k-1$ \\
Two elements are reversed, the remaining elements to reverse are $k-2$ and the starting index now will be $i+1$. \\
Increment $i$ by 1 and $k$ by 2. \\
Call the function recursively with new $i$ and $k$ \\
The correctness of this algorithm can be proved by induction. \\
Swapping the elements take O(log(n)) time because constant number of insertion and deletion are used for swapping. \\
And k is reduced by 2 in each recursive call, So there will be atmost k/2 recursion calls. Therefore the time complexity is O(klog(n))

\begin{lstlisting}
    def reverse(D, i, k):
        if k <= 1:
            return
        right = D.delete_at(i+k-1)
        left = D.delete_at(i)
        D.insert_at(i, right)
        D.insert_at(i+k-1, left)
        
        reverse(D, i+1, k-2)
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\problempart % Problem 2b
Solving recursively: \\
\textbf{Base case:} If k is 0, nothing needs to be done. Hence return. \\
\textbf{Recursive case:} If k is greater than 0, \\
Delete the element at index i. and subtract 1 from k. \\

There are two cases: \\
1. $j > i$ \\
After deletion of element at index i, all the elements after i will be shifted left by 1 and there indices are reduced by 1. \\
Insert the element at at index $j-1$ \\
Call the function recursively. \\ \\
2. Otherwise, \\
Insert the element at index j. \\
The next element to be moved is now at index i+1 and the next index to which it will be moved is at index j + 1. \\
Increment i by 1. \\
Increment j by 1. \\
Call the function recursively. \\

Insertion and deletion takes O(log(n)) time and k is reduced by 1 with each recursive call, So maximum recursive calls will be atmost k. And hence, the time complexity is O(klog(n)). \\
\begin{lstlisting}
    def move(D, i, k, j):
        x = D.delete_at(i)
        k -= 1
        if j > i:
            D.insert_at(j-1)
            move(D, i, k, j)
        else:
            D.insert_at(j)
            i += 1
            j += 1
            move(D, i, k, j)

\problem  % Problem 3 
\textit{--- After looking at solution ---} \\
Before placing the bookmarks, the pages can be stored in a static array of size $n$. \\
$read\_page(i)$ operation takes O(1) time to return a page at index $i$. \\

To place the bookmarks, three new dynamic arrays $A_1, A_2\ and\  A_3$ will be created: \\
$A_1$ contains the pages before bookmark $A$ \\
$A_2$ contains the pages between bookmarks $A$ and $B$. \\
$A_3$ contains the pages after bookmark $B$. \\

Building the dynamic arrays takes linear time. Therefore, $place\_mark(i, m)$ operation will take O(n) in worst case. \\

Also initialize 4 indices variables $a_1, a_2, b_1\ and\ b_2$. \\
$a_1$ points to the end of $A_1$ \\
$a_2$ points to the start of $A_2$ \\
$b_1$ points to the end of $A_2$ \\
$b_2$ points to the start of $A_3$ \\
\\
$A_1$ supports following operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item insert\_last()
    \item delete\_last()
\end{itemize}

$A_2$ supports following operations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item insert\_last()
    \item delete\_last()
    \item insert\_first()
    \item delete\_first()
\end{itemize}

$A_3$ supports following operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item insert\_first()
    \item delete\_first()
\end{itemize}

\newpage
* $read\_page(i)$: 
\begin{lstlisting}
    if i < a_2:
        return A_1[i]
    else if i < b_2:
        return A_2[i - a_2]
    else:
        return A_3[i - b_2]
\end{lstlisting}

$read\_page(i)$ takes O(1) time in worst case. \\

* $shift\_mark(m, d)$: \\
Moving a page from index $(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2)$ to the index $(a_2 - 1, a_1 + 1, b_2 - 1, b_1 + 1)$ respectively requires one deletion from a array and one insertion to another array and updating of the indices. \\ 
An array can be filled completely. In that case, the array can be rebuilt in O(n) time.\\

Therefore, this operation will take amortized O(1) time. \\

* $move\_page(m)$: \\
Moving the page at $(a_1, b_1)$ to the index $(b_1 + 1, a_1 + 1)$ requires one deletion, one insertion and updating of the indices. \\
Array can be filled completely. In that case, rebuild operation will be required which takes O(n) time. \\

This operation will also take amortized O(1) time.

\begin{problemparts}
\problempart % Problem 4a
$insert\_first(x)$ \\
Create a Node containing the item x. \\
Check the head of the list to see if list is empty. \\
If list is empty, set the Node as head and tail of the list and return. \\
If list is non-empty, get the head of the list called $first$, Connect $first$ as next element of $x$ and $x$ as previous element of $first$. \\ 
Set the head of the list to $x$. \\ \\
$insert\_last(x)$ \\
Create a Node containing the item x. \\
Check the tail of the list to see if list empty. \\
If list is empty, set the Node as head and tail of the list and return. \\
If list is non-empty, get the tail of list called $last$,
Connect $last$ as previous element of $x$ and $x$ as next element of $last$.\\
Set the tail of the list to $x$. \\ \\

$delete\_first()$ \\
Get the first two elements as $first$ and $second$. \\
Set $second$ as the head of the list and set $second.prev$ as None. \\
Return $first.item$. \\ \\ 

$delete\_last()$ \\
Get the last two elements as $last$ and $second\_last$. \\
Set $second\_last$ as tail of the list and set $second\_last.next$ as None. \\
Return $last.item$. \\

\newpage
\problempart % Problem 4b
Construct a new empty list $L2$. \\
There are four cases based on the location of $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the list: \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neither $x_1$ is head nor $x_2$ is tail: \\
    \hspace*{3em} Connect the element before $x_1$ to the element after $x_2$.
    \item $x_1$ is the head: \\
    \hspace*{3em} Set the head of the list to the element after $x_2$ and set the previous element of head as None.
    \item $x_2$ is the tail: \\
    \hspace*{3em} Set the tail of the list to the element before and set the next element of tail as None.
    \item $x_1$ is the head and $x_2$ is the tail: \\
    \hspace*{3em} Set the head and tail of the list to None.
\end{enumerate}

Independent of which case above was executed, \\
Set the previous element of $x_1$ and next element of $x_2$ as None. \\
Set the head of $L2$ to $x_1$ and the tail of $L2$ to $x_2$. \\

\problempart % Problem 4c
If $L2$ is an empty list, nothing needs to be done, hence return None. \\
Otherwise, \\
Get the element after $x$ in a variable $x\_next$. \\
Set the next element of $x$ to head of $L2$ and previous element of $L2.head$ to $x$. \\

If $x\_next$ is not None, Set previous element of $x\_next$ to tail of $L2$ and next next element of $L2's$ tail to $x\_next$. \\
Set the tail of $L$ as tail of $L2$. \\
Set head and tail of $L2$ to None. \\
